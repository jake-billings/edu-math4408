<a name="prerequisites">

<h3> Prerequisites</h3>

CSCI 2511 (Discrete Structures)

</a><a name="objectives">

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<ul>

<li> We will begin by acquiring knowledge of the basic tools in Graph Theory (models and representations, basic results on degrees, isomorphism, and connectivity. Then we will move on to more advanced topics such as Trees, Planarity, and Graph Coloring (including the Four Color Theorem), thickness, and games with graphs. If time permits, we will talk about the graph algorithm that is at the heart of Google's success.

</li></ul>

</a><a name="policies">
<h3>Grades and Policies</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Assignments and Quizzes:</b>

Homework assignments (6) will count toward 40%  percent of your grade. <b>You will not hand in homework assignments: each assignment will have an associated in-class quiz (20-30 minutes), which will be given only once. </b>The lowest score will be dropped.
<ul>
<li>Each assigment will have an assortment of straightforward problems as well as challenging problems. 
</li><li>To prepare for the quizzes, write up your
ideas on all of the problems that you have given some thought to, even if you do not believe you have a complete solution.
</li><li> Be sure to be neat, write in complete sentences, and do not leave out any steps: clarity of exposition may contribute toward a positive score. Please talk to one another about the assignments, but the write-ups should be done individually so that you are sure to be prepared for the quiz.</li></ul>
</li><li><b>Make-up  quizzes:</b> None. I will drop your lowest score. <b>There are no exceptions.</b>
</li><li><b>Midterm Exam (30% for undergrads, 20% for grads)</b> Given once only during class on Tuesday 6 March.
</li><li><b>Final  Exam (30% for undergrads, 20% for grads)</b> Given once only during class on Tuesday 1 May.
</li><li><b>Research paper presentation and software demonstration (20%)  <font color="red"> for graduate students only</font>. </b>A 15-30 minute (depending on the size of our class) research presentation to be given to your colleagues in class.  Early in the semester I will hand out a list of research papers from which you may choose a paper to present. You are expected to read and thoroughly understand the paper and the contents of the bibliography. In addition you will implement the ideas about which you have learned.You will prepare and present a conference-style presentation on your paper, complete with citations and a software demonstration at the end of the semester. A guide will be posted with the list of possible papers with more explanation.
